## Networking at a conference

## The elevator pitch

Personally, I find a plan of how to start a conversation means one less stress point

::: {.fragment}

We will develop an "Elevator Pitch" of you and your research!

## The elevator pitch

::::: {.fragment style="border: 1px solid black"}

#### Activity {style="color: firebrick; text-align: center; background: #FDEDEC"}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

Create your elevator pitch.

* Current position
* _Very_ brief research topic
* Something about the topic

## Networking at a conference

Some tips to help make a conference less intimidating:

::: {.incremental}

* Make a buddy [I can be your buddy]{.fragment style="font-size: small"}
* Maximise the meal breaks
* Use your elevator pitch
* Ask questions

:::

## Asking questions

Most people love talking about themselves.

We can practice asking questions!

## Finding a buddy

People bond through shared experiences^[Marsh et. al, _Social Connection Through Joint Action and Interpersonal Coordination_ Topics in Cognitive Science (2009)]

::: {.fragment style="border: 1px solid black"}

#### Activity {style="color: firebrick; text-align: center; background: #FDEDEC"}

::: {style="padding: 10px"}

In pairs, you will talk to each other **for 2 minutes**

Try to learn:

* Name
* Research topic
* A common thing, [i.e. hobby, food]{.fragment}[, hatred of University admin]{.fragment}
