## Teaching coding in modern statistics

The Business Analytics program at Monash University is _data first_

::: {.fragment}
Students learn coding from week 1 of their degree, and are working with data from week 2
:::

::: {.fragment}
This means that students see code as _part of their understanding_, rather than as a result of their understanding
:::

## A typical introductory tutorial

::: {.callout-tip}
We're up to Java 25 now... [👴]{.fragment}

## Competition in the classroom

There is plenty of research that suggest competition amongst students enhances learning outcomes:

* Chen, Law & Chen _The effects of peer competition-based science learning game on secondary students’ performance, achievement goals, and perceived ability_ Interactive Learning Environments (2018)

* Cagiltay et. al _The effect of competition on learning in games_ Computers & Education (2015)

::: {.fragment}
Anecdotally, we have run prediction competitions as assignments, and students are enormously engaged, start early, and regularly seek feedback
:::

## Code Golf

> Code golf is a type of recreational computer programming in which participants aim to solve a problem [accurately] using the least number of characters in their source code.

## Code Golf

In the depths of YouTube, Code Golf is a popular format for teaching programming concepts.

One of the most popular sites is [CSSBattles](https://cssbattle.dev/), where players compete to write the shortest CSS code to match a target design.

## `ggplot` battles

::: {.incremental}
* Built using `webR` and javascript
* No local R installation required
* Measures pixel-by-pixel correspondence
  * **not** code equality!
:::




## The system

::: {.incremental}
* Battles are self-contained R files
* Uses a quarto-like syntax for defining parameters and relevant text
* Open-source, more battles = more good

#| title: "Penguin Distributions"
#| dataset-name: "palmerpenguins::penguins"
#| colours: "`c('darkorange','purple','cyan4')`"
#| description: "The `palmerpenguins` dataset is one of the most famous in modern R programming. Data were collected and made available by [Dr. Kristen Gorman](https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/people/faculty/detail/kristen-gorman.php) and the [Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER](https://pallter.marine.rutgers.edu/), a member of the [Long Term Ecological Research Network](https://lternet.edu/). The original data is available [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)."

## Evaluating effect

Approved for a real-world education experiment in ETC1010/5510: Introduction to data analysis

::: {.incremental}
* Approximately 400 students
* Split class into two groups: one group uses `ggplot` battles, the other does not
* Run pre- and post- quizzes which evaluate their learning of `ggplot2` concepts
* Measure difference in score using a mixed-effects model, with a participant-level random effect
:::

## Quizzes

Monash uses Moodle as it's eLMS. Quizzes are designed using the `moodlequiz` RMarkdown package, which makes generating quizzes from R code fairly seamless.

## Quizzes

## Upcoming features

* IDE to look more IDE-like (variable windows, multiple files etc)
* User-account system for scoring and tracking
* Revamped battle categorisation since the number of battles has grown

## How can you help?

If you would like to use [ggplotbattles.dev](https://www.ggplotbattles.dev) in your own teaching, please do, and **please tell me about it**.

If you have an idea for a battle, please submit it to the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/MikeLydeamore/ggplot2-battles)
